# Book Search Engine

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project refactors an existing book search engine application from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API, utilizing Apollo Server. The application allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save books to their personal lists, and manage their saved books. It employs the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with GraphQL for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
